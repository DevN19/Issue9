                The Cask of Amontillado
            </div>
            <div class="pcontent">
                THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best
                could; but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.
                You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not
                suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. At length
                I would be avenged; this was a point definitively settled—
                but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,
                precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish
                with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution
                overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the
                avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has
                done the wrong.
                It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had
                I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued,
                as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive
                that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.
                He had a weak point—this Fortunato—although in
                other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared.
                He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few
                Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their
                enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity—to
                practise imposture upon the British and Austrian
                millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his
                countrymen, was a quack—but in the matter of old wines he
                was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him
                materially: I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and
                bought largely whenever I could.
                It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme
                madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend.
                He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been
                drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tightfitting parti-striped dress, and his head was
                surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I
                thought I should never have done wringing his hand.
                I said to him: “My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.
                How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have
                received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have
                my doubts.”
                “How?” said he. “Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible!
                And in the middle of the carnival!”
                “I have my doubts,” I replied; “and I was silly enough
                to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in
                the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of
                losing a bargain.”
                “Amontillado!”
                “I have my doubts.”
                “Amontillado!”
                “And I must satisfy them.”
                “Amontillado!”
                “As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If
                any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me——”
                “Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.”
                “And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match
                for your own.”
                “Come, let us go.”
                “Whither?”
                “To your vaults.”
                “My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good
                nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi——”
                “I have no engagement;—come.”
                “My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe
                cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are
                insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.”
                “Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing.
                Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for
                Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.”
